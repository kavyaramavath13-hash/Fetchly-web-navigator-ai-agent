# Fetchly-web-navigator-ai-agent
Fetchly is an AI-Powered Web Navigator Agent that turns natural language commands into automated browsing. It uses AI parsing, Flask backend, and Playwright automation to fetch results and display them in a simple web UI. Faster, smarter, and scalable for e-commerce, ticketing, education, and more🌐 AI-Powered Web Navigator Agent  

## 🚀 Problem Statement  
Users spend too much time navigating multiple websites for tasks like product search, ticket booking, or form filling.  
This process is repetitive, time-consuming, and challenging for non-technical users.  

Currently, no single intelligent system exists that allows natural language commands to automatically trigger web navigation and return structured results.

## 🎯 Objective  
To build a prototype agent that:  
- Accepts natural language queries.  
- Interprets intent and target platform (e.g., Amazon, IRCTC).  
- Uses **browser automation (Playwright)** to perform tasks.  
- Returns structured results in a simple **web interface**.

## 🌍 Applications  
- 🛒 **E-commerce product search** (Amazon, Flipkart).  
- 🚆 **Ticket booking** (IRCTC, flights).  
- 🍔 **Food delivery** (Zomato, Swiggy).  
- 🏛 **Government portals** (form filling, application tracking).  
- 🎓 **Education portals** (exam results, admission status).  

---

## 💡 Innovation & Uniqueness  
- Natural language to automated browsing.  
- Eliminates repetitive manual clicks.  
- Makes web navigation more inclusive & user-friendly.  
- Scalable to multiple domains (beyond e-commerce).  

---

## 📈 Future Scope  
- Smarter intent recognition with NLP/LLMs.  
- Multi-step automation (logins, form fill, payments).  
- Voice-enabled assistant.  
- Mobile app version.  
- Cross-platform expansion (extensions, APIs).
